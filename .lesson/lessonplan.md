# Project: Bouncing Ball

## Learning Objectives

* **Goal**: SWBAT plan and execute a large-scale program (100+ lines) using:
    - Play objects
    - if/elif/else conditional flow control
    - simple String concatenation
    - simple type casting
    - user input
    - global variables 
    - simple modulo operation (to keep angles valid).
* **Timing**: Approximately 1-2 weeks.

## Possible Success Criteria

The instructions.md file does NOT have a specific set of success criteria.  Depending on how you grade / what your policies are, how much time you have, and the age / maturity / dedication of your students, you may make wildly different choices here. Encourage students to keep the [Play Documentation](https://github.com/replit/play) open in a tab and reference that for the different objects, properties, and functions available.

There are minimum requirements for the game, such as having the ball bounce off the walls, incorporate a score/health system that is displayed, have the ball interact with other objects. Other than that, students may choose what types of input to use and to add as many features and enhancements as they have time for. 

Encourage students to add blocks to knock out, power ups (make bar longer), increase difficulty (increase speed) based on achieving a certain score, add some simple [randomness](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_randint.asp). For more advanced students, they could add a timer, incorporate multiple balls that bounce off each other, ... etc.

For a more limited time-frame, or for earlier beginner students, you could consider giving students more of the code from the exemplar. Consider also removing . Finally, identifying a pre-set list of commands that everyone in the class should use might help simplify.

## Using the Exemplar

This project has a provided exemplar. 

For many students, seeing an example of code like this written out will be necessary for them to have a strong mental image of how this should look. For others, merely running the code and playing it will be enough.

One possible approach to letting students get what they need from the exemplar:
- Run the game as a demo in a whole-class discussion, showing the functionality of the ball bouncing and when the score goes up and down. Ask guided questions about how they can keep track of the score and then display it (variables and concatenation), how the code knows when to bounce (if conditionals), etc.
- Hand out the code in hard-copy (not electronic) form. Or just snippets of code, such as only the left wall bounce if statement, as students have to figure out the other walls' conditions.
- Have students work in partners and pick out things in the code they find interesting, confusing, exciting, or that they would have done differently.
- Discuss as a class, making sure to highlight anything that many students have brought up as a confusion.

## Other Implementation Notes

As much as you can, get students playing each others' games and giving feedback.  You should do the same! Underscoring that programming is *for* something - that this is a game that someone should be able to play - is crucial to building investment and authenticity.

Keep an eye out for students adding additional ....  If a student is advanced or has prior experience, this might work out, but be aware.  It often is an indication that a conversation about a more well-thought-out plan is necessary.

You almost certainly have an urge to get students to structure some kind of plan in advance.  This obviously makes sense, but there is another appraoch here.  A natural-consequences philosophy might allow students to just start and see what happens, then assist them in developing better tools if/when they get in over their head. As this is an intro unit, there has been little emphasis on creating functions besides the `repeat_forever` section.
